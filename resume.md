[Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/gabriellewald/education-project/blob/main/Capstone1_pre_processing_training.ipynb)

*This project was an in-depth investigation of factors possibly affecting school performance*

- Designed predictive model to project the percentage of students passing standard tests in CA K-12 public schools
- Modeled training data with linear regression, lasso, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting
- Combined multiple datasets and tested hypotheses to address open ended questions
