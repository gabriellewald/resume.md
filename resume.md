I am a Data Scientist working to surface insights from data sets. I seek to inform the decision making process with science-based methods.

## Projects

### <span>Passing the Standards Projection</span> <span>May 2021</span>

A projection of the percentage of students passing test standards in California K-12 public schools:

   - Created unique dataset with test scores, financial investment in education, and several demographics regarding students and their families.
   - Modeled the training data to several regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Lasso and PCA)

## Experience

<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->
